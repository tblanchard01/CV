## Skills 

#### Organisation & Time Management

I have excellent organisation and time-management skills, which I have deployed during my time at Makers, and will carry forward into my first role as a software developer. 

During my previous role I was responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data for multiple clinical trials running in parallel, contributing to over 30 studies in total. Constant self-assessment of my responsibilities was required to ensure the data was processed and released without delay. I also previously trained as a Pharmacist within The Royal Berkshire Hospital; working on busy NHS wards required high levels of focus and efficiency, which resulted in the refinement of my organisational skills.

Whilst it is my ambition to move away from the Healthcare/Research sectors into a role as a software developer, my previous experiences have given me the ability to organise, prioritise, and remain focused under pressure, attributes which are highly transferable to the role of a software engineer.

#### Effective Interpersonal & Teamwork Skills ## 

Whilst I am comfortable working independently, I have excellent team-working and collaboration skills. In my previous role I collaborated with multinational groups to ensure project delivery, however I also have experience working in smaller close-knit groups, and pair programming. I also enjoy helping others to learn and progress and have experience in running training sessions for junior staff. I believe creating positive relationships with co-workers and collaborators is key to a productive work environment and will be a key focus for me as a developer. 

## Career before Makers <a name="career">

**Visioncare Research** (Feb '17 - July '18)<br/>*Clinical Data Manager*


 Previously employed with Visioncare Research in a Data Manager role. Visioncare Research is a Clinical Research Organization specialising in medical device trials in the UK & US. Responsible for ensuring data accuracy and validity through confirming adherence to trial protocols and Good Clinical Practice. My role required frequent liaison with Clinical Research Associates to resolve queries that arise from a trial, particularly those relating to concomitant medication issues experienced by trial subjects. My duties required expertise with a range of IT packages, with a focus on Microsoft Excel and the Bioclinica Express data capture system.  
Further responsibilities included:  
  
• Building study specific data validation tools.  
• Writing data management plans.  
• Creation of standard operating procedures.  
• Contributing to study database design.  
• Communicating with external partners to ensure adherence to study timelines.  
• Medical History/concomitant medication screening of trial subjects.

**Royal Berkshire Hospital** (July '15 - Jul '16)<br/>*Pre-registration Pharmacist*

Previously employed as a pre-registration pharmacist at the Royal Berkshire Hospital. This allowed me to sit and subsequently pass the pharmacy registration exam in September 2016. This was a very stimulating role which involved a high level of patient interaction and involvement in the safe and effective use of pharmaceutical therapies within the hospital. I completed several clinical rotations including medicines information, cardiology, elderly care, pediatrics, quality assurance, oncology and dispensary management.
