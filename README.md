## Tim Blanchard

Current Makers Academy student. Previously a Pharmacist working in a Clinical Research Organisation primarily performing Data Management. Seeking a role that will allow me to push my skillset as a developer. 

## Skills

#### Organisation & Time Management

I have excellent organisation and time-management skills, which I have deployed during my time at Makers, and will carry forward into my first role as a software developer. I successfully completed the first 4 weeks of the Makers Academy boot camp remotely, whilst working full time, demonstrating my ability to manage my own time effectively, and remain on-target under time constraints.

During my previous role I was responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data for multiple clinical trials running in parallel, contributing to over 30 studies in total. Therefore, being flexible in adjusting my priorities was vital in ensuring project delivery. Constant self-assessment of my responsibilities was required to ensure the datawas processed and released without delay. I also previously trained as a Pharmacist within The Royal Berkshire Hospital; working on busy NHS wards required high levels of focus and efficiency, which resulted in the refinement of my organisational skills.

Whilst it is my ambition to move away from the Healthcare/Research sectors into a role as a software developer, my previous experiences have given me the ability to organise, prioritise, and remain focused under pressure, attributes which are highly transferable to the role of a software engineer.

#### Effective Interpersonal & Teamwork Skills ## 

Whilst I am comfortable working independently, I have excellent teamworking and collaboration skills. In my previous role I collaborated with multinational groups to ensure project delivery, however I also have experience working in smaller close-knit groups, and pair programming. I also enjoy helping others to learn and progress and have experience in running training sessions for junior staff. I believe creating positive relationships with co-workers and collaborators is key to a productive work environment and will be a key focus for me as a developer.
