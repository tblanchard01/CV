## Tim Blanchard

Current Makers Academy student. Previously a Pharmacist working in a Clinical Research Organisation primarily performing Data Management. Seeking a role that will allow me to push my skilset as a developer. 

## Skills

#### Organisation & Time Management


During my previous role I was responsible for analysing the  responsible for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data for multiple clinical trials running in parallel, contributing to over 30 studies in total. Therefore, being flexible in adjusting my priorities is vital to ensure project delivery.For example, the rate at which trial subjects are enrolled or deselected from a trial can rapidly affect trial timelines, therefore constant self-assessment of my responsibilities was required to ensure the data is processed and released without delay. 

I previously trained as a Pharmacist within The Royal Berkshire Hospital; there are arguably fewer enviornments that demand organisation and time management than a busy NHS ward. 

Whilst it is my ambition to move away from the Healthcare/Research sectors into a role as a software developer, my previous experiences have given the ability to organise, prioritise, and remain focused under pressure, attributes which are highly transferable to the role of a software engineer.
